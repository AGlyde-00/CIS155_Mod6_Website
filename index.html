    <p class="thebest">Star Wars is one of the most expansive, diverse, and colorful worlds ever created. There is so
        much to explore and this page is largely to open the doors into exploring this amazing world.</p>
    <h2>MY TOP 3 FAVORITE CREATIONS IN ORDER</h2>
    <ol class="thebest">
        <li>Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith</li>
        <p>I love Episode 3 the most out of all the Star Wars saga. To watch the fall of Anakin and the beginning of
            Darth Vader is unbeatable. The fight scenes are the most emotion driven and meaningful. Plus the song Duel
            of Fates during the final duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan will never cease to be <em>epic</em>.</p>
        <li>Star Wars The Clone Wars animated series</li>
        <p>The animated series of Star Wars The Clone Wars fills in so much story that is missing from between Episodes
            2 and 3. It shows the minute details that led to Anankins distrust in the Jedi order and actually shows some
            of the atrocities of the Jedi. They aren't perfect. This is by no means me discrediting the Jedi order as
            they are still the peacekeepers and sometimes to keep the peace, peace is not an option.</p>
        <li>Andor</li>
        <p>Andor was simply a well written story. The narrative captures you and it provokes emotion and gives further
            reason to understand the necessity of the rebellion in the galaxy.</p>
    </ol>
